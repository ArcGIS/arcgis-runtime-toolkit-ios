[![doc](https://img.shields.io/badge/Doc-purple)](Documentation) [![Carthage compatible](https://img.shields.io/badge/Carthage-compatible-4BC51D.svg?style=flat)](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) [![CocoaPods](https://img.shields.io/cocoapods/v/ArcGIS-Runtime-Toolkit-iOS)](https://cocoapods.org/)

The ArcGIS Runtime SDK for iOS Toolkit contains components that will simplify your iOS app development. Check out the [Examples](/Examples) project to see these components in action or read through the [Documentation](/Documentation) to learn more about them.

To use Toolkit in your project:

* **[Install with CocoaPods](#cocoapods)** - Add `pod ArcGIS-Runtime-Toolkit-iOS` to your podfile
* **[Install with Carthage](#carthage)** - Add `github "esri/arcgis-runtime-toolkit-ios"` to your cartfile
* **[Build manually](#manual)** - Build and include manually if you'd like to customize or extend toolkit

## Toolkit Components

* **[Augmented reality (AR)](Documentation/AR)** - Integrates the scene view with ARKit to enable augmented reality (AR).
* **[Bookmarks](Documentation/Bookmarks)** - Shows bookmarks, from a map, scene, or a list.
* **[Compass](Documentation/Compass)** - Shows a compass direction when the map is rotated. Auto-hides when the map points north up.
* **[JobManager](Documentation/JobManager)** - Suspends and resumes ArcGIS Runtime tasks when the app is background, terminated, and relaunched.
* **[LegendViewController](Documentation/LegendViewController)** - Displays a legend for all the layers in a map or scene contained in an `AGSGeoView`.
* **[MeasureToolbar](Documentation/MeasureToolbar)** - Allows measurement of distances and areas on the map view.
* **[PopupController](Documentation/PopupController)** - Display details and media, edit attributes, geometry and related records, and manage the attachments of features and graphics (popups are defined in the popup property of features and graphics).
* **[Scalebar](Documentation/Scalebar)** - Displays current scale reference.
* **[TemplatePickerViewController](Documentation/TemplatePicker)** - Allows a user to choose a template from a list of `AGSFeatureTemplate` when creating new features.
* **[TimeSlider](Documentation/TimeSlider)** - Allows interactively defining a temporal range (i.e. time extent) and animating time moving forward or backward. Can be used to manipulate the time extent in a MapView or SceneView.

## Requirements

* [ArcGIS Runtime SDK for iOS](https://developers.arcgis.com/en/ios/) 100.7.0 (or higher)
* Xcode 10.2 (or higher)

The *ArcGIS Runtime Toolkit for iOS* has a *Target SDK* version of *11.0*, meaning that it can run on devices with *iOS 11.0* or newer.

## Instructions

### Cocoapods

 1. Add `pod ArcGIS-Runtime-Toolkit-iOS` to your podfile
 2. Run `pod install`. This will download the toolkit and the ArcGIS Runtime SDK for iOS which the toolkit depends upon and then configure your project to reference them both.	
 3. Add `import ArcGISToolkit` in your source code and start using the toolkit components 

 New to cocoapods? Visit [cocoapods.org](https://cocoapods.org/)

### Carthage

Carthage is a decentralized dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks.

 1. Add `github "esri/arcgis-runtime-toolkit-ios"` to your Cartfile
 2. Run `carthage update`
 3. Drag the `ArcGISToolkit.framework ` from the `Carthage/Build ` folder to the "TARGETS" settings for your application and drop it in the "Embedded Binaries" section in the "General" tab
 4. Add `import ArcGISToolkit` in your source code and start using the toolkit components 

New to Carthage? Visit the Carthage [GitHub](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) page.

Note that you must also have the __ArcGIS Runtime SDK for iOS__ installed and your project set up as per the instructions [here](https://developers.arcgis.com/ios/latest/swift/guide/install.htm#ESRI_SECTION1_D57435A2BEBC4D29AFA3A4CAA722506A).

### Manual

 1. Ensure you have downloaded and installed __ArcGIS Runtime SDK for iOS__ as described [here](https://developers.arcgis.com/ios/latest/swift/guide/install.htm#ESRI_SECTION1_D57435A2BEBC4D29AFA3A4CAA722506A)
 2. Clone or download this repo. 
 3. Drag and Drop the `Toolkit/ArcGISToolkit.xcodeproj` file into your project through the XCode Project Navigator pane.
 4. Drag the `ArcGISToolkit.framework` from the `ArcGISToolkit.xcodeproj/ArcGISToolkit/Products` folder to the "TARGETS" settings for your application and drop it in the "Embedded Binaries" section in the "General" tab
 5. Add `import ArcGISToolkit` in your source code and start using the toolkit components 

## SwiftLint

Both the Toolkit and Examples app support SwiftLint.  You can install SwiftLint from [here](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint).  It is not necessary to have it installed in order to build, but you will get a warning without it.  The specific rules the linter uses can be found in the `swiftlint.yml` files in the `Toolkit` and `Examples` directories.
